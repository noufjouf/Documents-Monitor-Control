# Documents-Monitor-Control
feat: This project aim to solve monitor and control document's permission by applying data science approch.

One of services has been provided to internal users is shared sites which providing saving and sharing
files between specific groups, to access these shared sites, there is access and level of permission 
should be granted to each user based on his related department and work. The problem is when some users
transfer to another department or their authority changed, their access to shared site should be changed
but as itâ€™s manual process, a lot of issues is happening and breaking user/ department privacy which is 
against cyber security policies.

Studying current staff hierarchy and shared site authority, apply correct matching and apply
a certain roll to provide correct permissions based on staff position and department. 
In future for any changing in employee hierarchy, the roll should be recommending the correct permission.
